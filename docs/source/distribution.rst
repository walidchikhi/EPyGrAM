Maintenance & Obligations
-------------------------

The package is distributed without maintenance obligation from the authors nor
Météo France (CNRM/GMAP).

Every bug report, porting matter, or functionality improvement can be addressed
by priority to the Issues system of the Redmine platform, or by mail
to alexandre.mary@meteo.fr.

Furthermore, the package is supposed to evolve in a collaborative way. Feel
free to contribute proposing your own developments, if general enough to 
potentially interest other people.
The source code management is hosted by a GIT repository, together with
a Redmine platform for project management.
However, the authors nor Météo France do not undertake to incorporate all
proposed contributions into the main
trunk of the code and the official releases.

New releases will be distributed with the above conditions, with information
to be delivered through the Redmine project and epygram@meteo.fr mailing-list.

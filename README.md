=======

__*Enhanced Python for Graphics and Analysis of Meteorological fields*__

---

# A version where we divided libs4py.so into two libraries to separate formats and spectral transforms handling within EPyGrAM


The epygram library package is a set of Python classes and functions designed to handle meteorological fields in Python, as well as interfacing their storage in various usual (or not) data formats.

Dependencies
------------

EPyGrAM dependencies are mostly available from Pypi (pip install ...), except a few site packages from the [Vortex](https://opensource.umr-cnrm.fr/projects/vortex) project, mainly the `footprints` and `bronx` packages.

Installation
------------

Installation can be done in local user site-packages with the help of the `_install/setup_epygram.py` script.
This script usage is autodocumented (option `-h`) about its options.

Then follow instructions printed by the script to complete installation.
